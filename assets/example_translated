The Ali Baba robbers
And fairy tales Scheherazade had thick
But Master sleeves, now for it
With my magic you every trick

You are now in the heavyweight desire free
You have an arsenal
You now have fire, flame, sweeping cut it out!
Just rub the lamp and I will come again

Then I say:

My master Aladdin
Please be desired?
The order, oui
Tout suite, now!
Is only? S little friendly to me

Who will be hungry for?
I'm always here!
Whisper me just what purely in the ears
Is only? S little friendly to me!

Yes, yes, customers are sacred to us
You are King, Emperor, crowd
You're the boss
I'm listening to
Meanwhile, Akrabar

Take what the A-menu
but also B I empfehl you
Man deprecated house, nu pack already made
Only? S little friendly to me

Wish for you this
Wish for you the
Wish you Magic, in excess

Wish for you fire
Well look at times
Wish for you fetzten abracadabra, fly
And suddenly they are no longer there

Young man, do not look so, what did you just?
Your prayers have been answered yet
One you will go with me the big prize
